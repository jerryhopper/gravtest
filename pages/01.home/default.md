# Jerry Hopper
## the infamous nonfluencer

Congratulations! You have installed the **Base Grav Package** that provides a **simple page** and the default **Quark** theme to get you started.



! NOTE: The page will automatically show up in the Menu after the "Typography" menu item. If you wish to change the name that shows up in the Menu, simple add: `menu: My Page` between the dashes in the page content. This is called the YAML front matter, and it is where you configure page-specific options.
